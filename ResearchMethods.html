										<h2>Ethics In Computing Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As the capabilities of technology continue to advance, ethics in computing becomes an increasingly relevant topic. According to Stahl et al (2016), privacy is a dominant ethical concern. In my experience working for Calgary Transit, a public transit agency, we have to be mindful of the impacts of collecting any data that could be used to identify a person. This goes beyond just making sure that all activities are legal, but also ensuring that the organization maintains public trust.</p>
									<p>An example of this concern could be the desire for the organization to gather data regarding both origin and the final destination of passengers utilizing the transit network, so that it can be optimized to provide the public with the best possible service. With CCTV cameras in place on all vehicles and at train stations, there is the possibility of utilizing these cameras to perform facial recognition and track a persons movement through the transit network. The system would temporarily store data for a persons face at the departure location, and use that to match them to where they are last seen as their final destination. After not being seen for a certain amount of time, the departue and destination locations and times would be saved, while all data related to the person would be deleted. While the idea is simple and straightforward to implement, there are many concerns and roadblocks in developing this system.</p>
									<p>While it is not prohibited under Canada’s data privacy act PIPEDA (2019), or Alberta’s Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (2023) to use facial recognition for this purpose, a few important steps are required to ensure it does not infringe on the publics rights. Being a public service, the cameras are located on public property and not private property. Lack of transparency and knowledge of an active facial recognition system is among the leadings concerns around the implementation of these systems (Solarova et. Al, 2023), which is especially important when considering that this would be occuring in a public space instead of on private property. Therefore, it would be important to make sure that all passengers were made aware of the fact that this data collection was occuring. This could be done through the use of signs, and company announcements to the public to make sure that they know of this data collection.</p>
									<p>Another important component of this system is to ensure that peronal information such as the data used to match a persons face, is only being kept for as long as it is necessary. Minimizing the amount of time this information is held reduces the impact of any potential attack, and ensures that any identifying information is not being held so that it is not possible to be used later in a different application. This anonymization of the data helps to comply with legislation such as GDPR (Siegert et al, 2020), or in this case PIPEDA and Freedom of Information and Privacy Act, as once the individual is no longer identifiable it is not considered personal data. My recommendation to ensure that this is met is to remove all of the personal data once a person has not been seen in the network for 45 minutes, as at that point it is assumed that their trip has ended and they’ve reached their destination. At this point the origin and destination locations and times can be extracted without any further need to identify the individual.</p>
<p>Finally, Calgary Transit would need to ensure that the facial recognition was only being used for the purpose that they have advertised, which is to better understand origin and destination of travellers utilizing the network. Controlling the way in which personal data is used is an effective method  of ensuring data privacy conditions are met (Landau, 2015), and can help to ensure the organization complies with PIPEDA. This system would likely gain attraction and demand from other interested departments within the city such as law enforcement, but allowing them access to this system to identify and track criminals or suspicous individuals would violate the privacy act, as the personal data is no longer being used for the purpose that it was advertised and collected for.</p>
									<p>While following all of these steps would have ensured that the collection and use of this data complied with all data privacy laws here in Alberta, my recommendation would be to continue searching for an alternative technology that is less invasive, and to continue with their current method of using infrared cameras to track boardings and alightings for now as no personal data is gathered from that system. Informing the public of the decision to use facial recognition would harm the reputation of the organization, and likely cause backlash from riders who have concerns about the use of the technology. The negative impact that this would have on the organization outweighs the positive of having better data for improving the transit network. While gaining origin and destination data could have significant benefits to how Calgary Transit is able to best serve their customers, this collection may be better suited to a tap on, tap off payment system as it will not involve the same level of surviellance and monitoring in public spaces as facial recognition does.</p>

									<p>Case Study: Malware</p>

<p>In this case study, Rogue services is a cheap web hosting company used by botnets to protect their servers from take down attempts while spreading malware and spam. Increased malware distribution is a challenge for IT and can often cause losses in terms of time and resources (IT Professional, 2005)</p>
									
<p>By protecting these malicious services, Rogue was not acting in the best interests of the public. Despite this, the actions taken to take down Rogues network caused the loss of data for other legitimate parties that were using Rogues services responsibly. This makes it difficult to say whether the actions taken were ethical or the correct professional action, as the extent of damage caused by allowing the service to stay online vs the damage caused to innocent clients when taking it down changes in each scenario like this and needs to be carefully measured. The parties involved can justify their actions by stating that what they did was in the best interests of the public, and the ACM Code (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) considers this scenario in section 2.8 if the reasons are for the best interest of the public. The BCS code (British Computer Society, 2022) does not specify the ability to perform these actions even if it’s in the publics best interest, and leaves it up to interpretation on if this action would be allowed. Had further steps been taken to allow clients to keep their data before taking down Rogues services, less harm would have come to the legitimate clients.</p>

<p>From the legal point of view, the country that Rogue was hosted in did not have laws preventing this type of hosting activity, therefore it is important that the vendors involved had the support of their respective governments. While this may give them the authorization to proceed, there is still the need to consider that the attack could violate the code by having negative consequences on their reputation and the reputation of the profession, especially since innocent customers were affected.</p>
									
<p>In summary, the scenario in this case study highlighted the complexity of interpreting these codes in difficult situations, and the importance of considering all consequences before taking any action. The legal and ethical responsibilities are left to the interpretation of what is considered to be in the 'publics best interest', and it is important to ensure that all relevant authorities also interpret these actions to be in the publics best interest before proceeding.</p>

										<h2>Discussion 1 Peer Response</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hi Leigh, I enjoyed reading your comments, especially regarding who should be held accountable for failing to adhere to the principles. While I can also understand a developer doing as he’s told once his concerns are dismissed, the same could be argued for the development agency. At the end of the day, they are both just doing what they are told in order to generate income. I do agree with you that despite this, both the developer and the agency should be held accountable for failing to adhere to the principles.</p>
									

									<p>From a legal standpoint, it is likely only the client would have legal implications as they are the ones misleading consumers and adding hidden charges without permission such as the protection plan. However, from a professional and ethical standpoint the developer and agency were aware of how their work would be used to manipulate consumers and completed the job anyways. As stated previously this is in clear violation of the sections of both the BCS and ACM codes regarding public interest and professional integrity, while also potentially bringing the reputation of the profession into disrepute.</p>
									
									<p>In summary, while I do understand that the developer and agency were only making the changes as they were told in order to satisfy a client, I don’t believe this is a good justification for ignoring the principles set out in the code of conduct as they were aware of the potential damages.</p>

										<h2>Discussion 1 Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In my initial post I provided a summary of the malware case study in which Rogue Services was hosting malicious content that spread malware and spam, and were forcibly taken down in a joint effort through vendors and government agencies. I stated that that while Rogue was not following the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) and BCS (British Computer Society, 2022) codes by not acting in the publics best interests, the effort to take them down was and therefore could be seen as following the guidelines. This opens a debate as to who decides what's in the publics best interest, as innocent and legitimate businesses lost their data and were affected in the process.</p>
									<p>In discussion with my colleagues, it was mentioned that disabling Rogues services without safeguarding the legitimate data shows a lacking risk assessment, and could bring their reputation into disrepute. It also suggests issues around professional competence for this task, and would violate both the ACM and BCS codes. We also discussed how it can be difficult to weigh ethics against the outcome in cybersecurity, as sometimes the best outcome for most of the public can involve harming other innocent users. These discussions have helped to emphasize the importance of proper planning and risk assessment when dealing with cyber security issues, as unforeseen issues or consequences such as innocent users losing their data can have repercussions and bring professional competence into question.</p>

										<h2>Questionnaire Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The assignment for this week is to find and critique a questionnaire. The River Access Strategy Questionnaire from the City of Calgary (2016) was looking for feedback based on available boat and hand launch sites along the Bow River in the city. The target audience for this questionnaire looks to be residents in Calgary that use the rive for activities such as rafting, boating, or kayaking, which require a place to launch. The questionnaire consists of 10 open questions where the respondent can type their anwser, primarily focusing on the locations of launch sites along the river, and other requirements or suggestions of anything that should be included at or near the launch sites.</p>

									<p>The open questions give the respondent the opportunity to express their feelings and share detailed information regarding the city’s plan, however I feel that the city could improve on the questionnaire by adding in some closed questions to gain categorical data. An example of this would be to understand how the respondent is travelling to the launch points (car, bike, walk, etc.), as it could affect their view on requirements such as parking. Additionally, understanding how frequently they use a launch site, or what type of watercraft they are launching, may provide deeper insights into specific challenges that affect these groups of people.</p>

										<h2>Literature Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p>For my literature review, I focused on the research question: “How are deep learning techniques implemented in autonomous vehicles to detect pedestrians?”. I found this topic to be quite interesting to read and study about, as I’ve always had a deep interest in computer vision. This aside, trying to determine a specific topic for the literature review was extremely challenging for me. I found that my research was all over the place as I first started, and with every paper I read my thoughts on what my focus should be was changing. This caused a long period of time from when I started my research to when I had an idea on my topic, which is something I can improve going into my final project. The feedback I received mentioned how my ideas were not always clear and that I could have used more literature to develop critical discussions. I think that this was the impact of my indecision through this project, and gives me a target to improve for my final project.</p>

<p>Abi is obligated to present both the positive and negative results, regardless of how they are presented by the manufacturer going forward. Anything else would be intentionally hiding data to support a particular stance, which is unethical and could have a negative impact on both his and his institutes reputation. If Abi only shared partial results, he would be contributing to a loss in knowledge on the product (Sabatello et. Al, 2022). While Abi believes that Whizzz would only publicize the positive results, having the negative results shown to them could help them better understand their product and be used to make improvements, even if they’re not shared with the public.</p>					
<p>Abi is not responsible for how Whizzz decides to share the results of the study, but can take steps to mitigate the impact of Whizzz only sharing selective results. Including all results in both his report and any report published by the research institution means that while Whizzz can selectively share positive results from the report, they cannot directly share the report from the institution without showing all results. Given that this seems to be a study funded by Whizzz, Abi and the research institution should have a data sharing agreement in place with Whizzz before beginning the study to allow them to publish and share the results, regardless of what they turn out to be.</p>

										<h2>Discussion 2 Peer Response One</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hi Ruth, Thank you for your post. While I agree with most of what you’ve said, I do believe that their can be a case Whizzz having both positive and negative correlations with a persons health. The wording in the post is not very specific as you mentioned, saying that Whizzz could be seen as nutritious or harmful depending on how the data is presented. The same could be said about dried fruits, which have many nutrients and fibres to be considered nutritious, yet the high sugar content could be harmful to dental health (Sadler et. Al, 2019). This doesn’t necessarily mean that the results are inconclusive, but that the nutritional benefits and potential harmful effects of Whizzz could be unrelated or circumstantial (ie. Overconsumption)</p>

									<p>The wording in the case study makes it difficult to know if this is the case, but regardless of this I agree that the final decision on how to manage the information should be handled by management and not by Abi. By reporting all of his findings Abi ensures that he is protecting both himself and the research institution should their be any investigations based on the reports Whizzz publishes from this data.</p>

									<p>Hi Samuel, thank you for your thoughtful post. You are right in saying that the research’s integrity is undermined if the full results aren’t reported. This reporting bias leads to a different story being told instead of the reality, and therefore all results should be published regardless of if they are negative, positive, or seem non-significant at the time (Dawson & Dawson, 2018). The results may become more significant as further studies are done, but will not be realized if they are excluded from the report because they were not judged to be important. As you mentioned reporting all results can help to protect Abi and the research institution in the case of an investigation into any results that Whizzz decides to make public. Having a record that all results were shared and not just the positive ones that Whizzz publicized ensures that even though Whizz did not act ethically, Abi and the institution did.</p>

										<h2>Discussion 2 Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In my initial post I stated that Abi is obligated to present all results, regardless if they’re positive or negative for Whizzz. Withholding some results would be dishonest and unethical, and could also cause a loss of knowledge related to the product (Sabatello et. Al, 2022). As mentioned by my peers, presenting all results protects Abi from the potential consequences of covering up potential harm of the product (Buzby et. Al, 2001). If Whizzz makes false claims about the product they would breach food safety standards (FSA, 2023), and presenting all results protects Abi in the case of an investigation.</p>
									<p>In all of our discussions there are no arguments for Abi to withhold any of the results for Whizzz, highlighting ethics and self-protection as the key reasons. I also stated that Abi should have taken additional steps to prevent this ethical dilemma before starting the project. Considering that it was funded by Whizzz, Abi should have identified this potential issue before starting and made an agreement about publishing the full data results. We were all in agreement that any decision by Whizzz to only share positive outcomes of the report is not Abi’s responsibility, as long as he was thorough in his report and included all of his findings.</p>

										<h2>Summary Measures</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The first exercise is to calculate the sample size, average, and standard deviation of people on diet B. The example walked us how to do this with diet A by using the count(), averaage(), and stdev() functions. Both diets had a sample size of 50, diet A had a mean of 5.341 and standard deviation of 2.536. Diet B had a mean of 3.710, and a standard deviation of 2.769. This tells us that diet A is more effective, as the average weight loss is much greater than diet B. The higher standard deviation in diet B tells us that the results between individuals on that diet were more variable than between patients in diet A, indicating that the results of the diet were less consistent among those in group B. Both of these point to the fact that diet A is more effective than diet B.</p>
  <p>Exercise 2 was to calculate the median, first and third quartile, and interquartile range of diet B. This was done using the median() and quartile() functions. Diet A had a median of 5.642, first quartile of 3.748, third quartile of 7.033, and interquartile range of 3.285. Diet B had a median of 3.745, first quartile of 1.953, third quartile of 5.404, and interquartile range of 3.451. The first and third quartile, and median are all significantly greater in diet A compared to diet B, while the interquartile range is similar for both diets A and B. This tells us that diet A was consistently more effective than diet B between the first and third quartile, supporting the findings in the first exercise that diet A is more effective than diet B.</p>

<p>In the third exercise, we are counting the number of people and percentage of the total in each area that prefer cereal Brand A, Brand B, or Other for Area 1 and Area 2. In area 1, 11 people (15.7%) prefer brand A, 17 (24.3%) prefer brand B, and 42 (60%) prefer other. In area 2, 19 (21.1%) prefer brand A, 30 (33.3%) prefer brand B, and 41 (45.6%) prefer other. In both areas, other was the most popular choice, followed by brand B and then brand A. Although the frequency for other was similar in regions 1 and 2, region 2 had a larger sample size, and other was far less popular compared to region 1 as shown by the percentages. Similarly, the percentages show that brand B was 9% more popular in region 2 and brand A was 5.4% more popular in region 2, compared to region 1. Looking at the frequencies would have made the change look much larger, however the two regions have a different sample size.</p>

									<p>The fourth exercise is to perform a two tailed t-test on the filtration dataset, which shows the amount of impurities after the agent was used. Agent 1 had a mean of 8.25, while agent 2 had a mean of 8.68. The related samples had t = -3.26 and 11 degrees of freedom. The p-value was 0.0075, and since this is less than 5% it means that the null hypothesis is rejected and the results are significant. This means that Agent 1 was more effective than Agent 2 as there were less impurities left behind.</p>
<p>The fifth exercise asks us to perform a one tailed t-test on the same dataset. For agent 1 to be more effective as asked in the question, agent 2 would have to leave more impurities. Therefore we have a null hypothesis of Agent1 being >= Agent 2, and test this. This output was already generated in exercise 4. Agent 1 had a mean of 8.25, while agent 2 had a mean of 8.68. The related samples had t = -3.26 and 11 degrees of freedom. The p-value was 0.0038, meaning that the results are significant that Agent 2 leaves more impurities than Agent 1. The p-value suggests a higher level of significance than the 2 tailed test, as the p-value is much smaller, and we reject the null hypothesis as agent 2 leaves more impurities.</p>
	<p>The last exercise is to determine if the population mean of males exceeds that of females. Unlike the last two exercises, the data points are not paired. So we first perform an F test to determine if we should be using a T-test that assumes equal variance between groups or not. The F statistic is F = 1.226 with 59 and 59 degrees of freedom. The two tailed p-value is 0.436, and therefore is not significant. Therefore we use the two sample assuming equal variance t-test. The mean for males was 52.913, and females was 44.233. The T statistic is 3.268, and a p value of 0.00142. This means the results are significant, and the average income of males is higher than females.</p>

									<p>The first exercise is to create a bar chart for Area 2 in the ceral brand dataset. Placing it beside the chart for area 1, it becomes obvious that there is a much smaller gap between ‘other’ and brand A and B in area 2. The choice of breakfast cereal is more evenly spread. With the charts side by side as stated in the instructions, it’s important to note the different axis for the two charts. Since the other column is the same height in both charts, it gives the impression that it is equally popular in both charts. For this reason two pie charts or a clustered column chart may be more appropriate for a side by side comparison, as the scale won’t lead to misinterpretation of the results.</p>
									<p>Exercise 2 is to create a clustered column chart of the frequency percentages for the prevalence of Heathers in two different regions. The clustered column charts show clear opposite patterns. Location A increases from Absent to Sparse to Abundant, While Location B does the opposite. This tells us that Heathers tend to be much more prevalent in Location A.</p>
									<p>The third exercise asks us to create a histogram to represent those on diet B, to compare with the histogram we made in the example for diet A. Putting the two histograms side by side, it’s clear to see that the histogram has shifted to the left for diet B. This visual makes it clear that Diet B is more frequent in each bucket <= 3, while less frequent in buckets 5, 7, 9, and 11. This supports the analysis we did last week that found Diet B to be less effective for weight loss.</p>

										<h2>Research Proposal</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My research proposal aimed to build on the literature review that I created in unit 7, to answer the question: “How can 3D pose estimation be applied to pedestrian detection systems to predict pedestrian movements?”. In my research proposal, my main focus was on developing a methodology that could be used for a successful project. In doing this, I did not include enough detail and discussion regarding the significance of the research, and critical discussions. This was evident in the feedback on my submission, highlighting the need for deeper discussions in these areas. Preparing a research proposal in this module was quite valuable to me, as I feel that I have a much better understanding of the process and how to successfully develop a research proposal for my final project.</p>

  									<figcaption>Figure 1: SWOT analysis for this module</figcaption>
									<p>The work in this module was very different to all of the preceding modules, with more focus on preparing us for our research project. In my SWAT analysis shown in Figure 1, This module brought forward my strengths in statistical analysis and interest in research. I found my statistical analysis skills to be quite strong, and going through those units was straightforward for me and served as a refresher. I also believe that my interest in the research topic is considered a strength, as I feel highly motivated to learn more and contiinue working towards it.</p>
									<p>I had many weaknesses exposed in this module, in the form of clarity, focus, and self doubt. With so many potential options for research that interest me, my early work was spread far too thin on a variety of topics, with no clear scope or direction. It caused me to doubt in my ability to complete the assignments, and the final research project to come. If I were to follow a similar approach for my final project, I would be lost from the start and always trying to catch up.</p>
									<p>Any weakness leads to the opportunity for improvement. In my assignments I’ve received detailed feedback on the lack of clarity, direction, and criticality of certain components of work. Addressing the feedback I’ve received will help me to directly reduce the weakness that were so prominent in this module. A focus on continuously improving the way I work is key to ensuring that they are improved on, and that I improve my work in any possible way.</p>
									<p>The biggest threat to my project is time management. From week 1 it is expected that I’ll have a clear direction and be working towards an outline and proposal for my project. Wasting time exploring too many new topics, or research not relevant to what I plan to study will greatly impact my ability to be successful in the final project.</p>
									<p>As I move into the final project, It is important that I look back to what I’ve learned in this module so that I can address my weaknesses with the opportunities provided here, while utilizing my strengths. With time being such an important factor in the final project, I will need to be well organized and plan ahead moivng into my final project.</p>

										<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
									</header>
  <p>The content in this module was mainly focused on the research methods that would be required to complete our final project for the program, aligning with the goals stated in the beginning of the module of developing research strategies and competencies. This involved the literature review and research proposal that were required as part of the graded components of this course. There was also an additional focus on the ethics of computing as seen in our two discussion forums and our unit 1 reflection, and statistical analysis to ensure we have the necessary skills to draw insights from the data gathered for our projects. </p>
	<p>The reflection piece completed in unit 1 set the pace for this module, forcing thoughts about the ethical questions we will have to ask ourselves while working in this field. My reflection on the use of facial recognition in public spaces provided great value to me, as I was forced to do more research into Alberta’s Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (2023), and Canadas data privacy act PIPEDA (2019). While previous modules had spent much time discussing the laws around private data they’ve been focused on the GDPR (2016), understanding the differences between these acts such as how PIPEDA does not include restrictions on public agencies as they are restricted by provincial Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts instead, was valuable to me as I continue my career here in Canada.</p>
	<p>In the first discussion I focused on the malware case study, and how it related to the British Computer Society (2022) and Association of Computing Machinery (2018) code of conducts. This case study highlighted the challenges that can be involved in the case of harmful activity being hosted in a region where the authorities are not interessted in shutting it down. Even though I had concluded that they had done the correct thing in taking to the hosting provider, Innocent people still lost their data in the crossfire in this case study. It shows the importance of understanding every consequence of your actions before performing any task, both the good and the bad.</p>
	<p>I found the literature review to be an extremely challenging task for me to complete. Indecision regarding what the correct topic to focus my literature review on made it difficult to focus in on a topic, as the more I read I continued to change my mind on what I should be reviewing. This experience highlighted the importance of developing a strong research question early on to help guide the next steps. While my indecision made the literature review quite stressful and challenging for me, I believe it is extremely valuable to have gone through that process for the first time now, as opposed to when I start my final project.</p>
	<p>Our second discussion regarding Whizzz, and what responsibilities the researcher, Abi,  has in providing conflicting data that has the potential for misuse. This discussion seemed very straightforward as my colleagues and I were all on the same page regarding Abi’s responsibility to share the complete results, both the positive and negative correlations that were discovered. Anything else would be dishonest, and would mean that it was Abi, not Whizzz, who was unethical in this situation. This problem is very relevant to me in my current work for the City of Calgary, as often times city councellors request data but are only interested in seeing results that support their claims to the public. For this reason it was reassuring to see my colleaugues would handle the situation in a similar way to what I have been doing, providing all relevant information even if it puts the councellors claims in a bad light.</p>
	<p>Having completed the numeric analysis module prior to this, the weeks spent on satistical analysis were straightforward. It was important to cover these topics to ensure students are prepared going into their project, however I don’t feel that I gained new skills or knowledge by completing the worksheets. All of their contents had been covered in past modules, these assignments were just used to refresh my knowledge.</p>
	<p>Creating a research proposal and presentation was the second graded assignment for this module. I decided to build on my literature by focusing on the same topic of pedestrian detection in autonomous vehicles. Already having decided on a topic for my proposal made this much easier to approach compared to the literature review, once again highlighting how important proper planning will be as I begin my final project. Spending most of my time trying to develop a working methodology resulted in insufficient discussion around the importance of the work being done, and what it can add to the field.</p>
	<p>With the primary learning objectives for this module relating to learning methods, strategies, and gaining competencies for reasearch, the two graded assignments were crucial to meeting these objectives. These assignments showed me what I need to improve on in order to be successful moving into the final project. Although I’m not yet clear in knowing if I’m pursuing the correct topic for my final research, I believe that being better organized with a clear direction in what I want to research and my reasons for pursuing the study will help me to start off my final project in a successful way. The discussion forums and early reflection on ethics were valuable in ensuring that future research and work is done in an ethical way, emphasizing the importance and difficulties in maintaining good ethics in professional, legal, and social manners. With all of these considered I believe that I have achieved the outcomes of this module, having deepened my research knowledge and practiced the early stages of the process. Following my professional development plan to improve on my work I believe this module has set me up to be successful in future research.</p>
